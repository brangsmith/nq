The goal of this resource is to educate on, inform and facilitate the use of qualitative methods in neurosurgery.<br>This resource is aimed at anyone who practices or has an interest in the field of neurosurgery, and who wishes to learn about or utilise qualitative methods, in their own research. The resource consists of six units which are supplemented with podcasts, reflective exercises and links to other resources. There is also blog posts with contributions from various members of the development and review teams. It is important to highlight that this is an emerging resource that will continue to evolve with the ongoing developments within the field of qualitative inquiry, and through feedback and suggestions from users and external reviewers. Our plans for the following year include the addition of a glossary and more interactive and training activities for each unit. We welcome all and any feedback or contributions that will allow for the refinement and improvement of this resource.
