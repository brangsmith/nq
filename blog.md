> <H3>"Using NEURO_QUAL as a medical student"</H3>
> 
> <i> by Lara Onbasi, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey</i>


As a medical student, I believe one of the most important aspects of medical practice for me to learn is the qualitative aspect of research and treatment. I see this as a very crucial part of my training because it will help me understand patient experiences and how change can be implemented in different areas of medicine. So, I find it very exciting whenever I see new research published on the qualitative aspects of neurosurgery, since it is a specialty that I am very interested in, and try to keep up with the increasing knowledge in this field as much as I can. That is how I found Neuro_Qual and as soon as I saw the vision for this project, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. It is incredible to be a part of the team working on Neuro_Qual, which will undoubtedly be an invaluable resource for neurosurgeons and neurosurgery & research enthusiasts around the globe.

Even though we are taught about many different medical specialties and get to have some experience in most of them throughout our education, it is unfortunately less often that we get the chance to explore the intricacies and the meaning behind different research paradigms. This is especially pronounced when it comes to qualitative research. I see the opportunity to learn about this subject and its overall importance very valuable, since it has incredible potential to help us explore, understand, and improve our approaches to different parts of medical practice. Having access to a comprehensive resource to learn about this is truly amazing.

The fact that the content of this resource is supported with podcasts and the approach to the topics are from a really interesting and fundamental point of view, will help make it even more useful. It has made me motivated to be involved in qualitative research, especially since I am starting to build my knowledge on this subject with a methodological perspective through Neuro_Qual. I also see this project as having the potential to reach many people and encourage them to explore and engage in qualitative research. I hope that many people working in the field of neurosurgery or just interested in this specialty get to benefit from Neuro_Qual and learn about the importance and principles of qualitative research in neurosurgery. I am also looking forward to using and discovering more about the field that I am interested in with Neuro_Qual myself, of course!
